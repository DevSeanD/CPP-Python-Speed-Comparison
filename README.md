# CPP-Python-Speed-Comparison
A respository dedicated to testing speed discrepancies between C++ and Python

These test will be conducted on the same machine(Thinkpad x220T 8gb ddr3 memory and i5 2.4ghz processor) using the unix time command.

The time command will be used instead of implementing a timer in each program. Using the time command limits the variables and allows for a more direct and fair comparison between C++ and Python programs.
